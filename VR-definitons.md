## INTRO TO GENERAL VR DEFINITIONS*
- 'Virtual Reality' is a nice buzzword that can mean a lot of different things depending on who you talk to.
- The key element to virtual reality is immersion... __the sense of being surrounded.__
- A good novel is immersive without any fancy graphics or audio hardware. You 'see' and 'hear' and 'touch' and 'taste' and 'smell'
- A good play or a film or an opera can be immersive using only sight and sound.

But they aren't __interactive__ which is another key element.

Older textual computer games from the late 70s and early 80s  such as Adventure, Zork, and the Scott Adams (not the Dilbert guy) adventures  are immersive and interactive and place the user within a computer generated world, though that world was created only through text. You can play adventure online at http://www.astrodragon.com/zplet/advent.html. You can play Zork online at http://thcnet.net/zork/index.php or http://www.xs4all.nl/~pot/infocom/ or at several other sites. The Scott Adams adventures are playable at http://www.freearcade.com/Zplet.jav/Scottadams.html

Games in the early 80s started to incorporate primitive graphics to go along with the text, such as Mystery House below.

and even simple 1st person graphics in games such as Akalabeth and Wizardry below, though the screen refresh rate was something less than real-time. The screen took a long time (up to several seconds) to re-draw so these games tended to be more strategy-based on a turn-taking model.

If we move towards modern computer games, they are immersive and interactive. These also have the advantage of being real-time running at 30 to 60 frames per second, another key element.
Another key element of VR is a viewer centered perspective where you 'see' through your own eyes as you move through a computer generated space, interact with objects there, and more often than not kill everyone you meet. The way you see the environment is limited to a screen with a narrow angle of view and you use a keyboard / joystick / gamepad to change your view of that scene.

__VR adds the concepts of head tracking, wide field of view and stereo vision__

__Head tracking__ allows the user to look around the computer generated world by naturally moving his/her head. A wide field of view allows the computer generated world to fill the user's vision. Stereo vision gives extra cues to depth when objects in the computer generated world are within a few feet.

As Dan Sandin likes to say, this gives us the first re-definition of perspective since the Renaissance (16th century)

Albrecht DÃ¼rer, Draughsman Drawing a Recumbent Woman (1525) Woodcut illusion from 'The Teaching of Measurements.'
Audio also plays a very important role in immersion (try listening to a modern Hollywood film without its musical score) and haptic (touch) feedback can provide important cues while in smaller immersive spaces.
And there is some work in trying to deal with smell (the HITLab in the late 90s, and Yasuyuki Yanagi, Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute, Kyoto more recently) and taste (Hiroo Iwata, University of Tsukuba.)

So here is a picture that puts a lot of this together ... Randy Smith of General Motors in their CAVE. Randy is real. The car seat Randy is sitting in is real. The rest is computer generated.

## VR Hardware
Head Mounted Display
BOOM mounted Display
Fish Tank
Large Format (Projection Based or Flat Panel Based)
For large format based systems, some companies that sell these things are:
Mechdyne
Barco
For Head Mounted Displays, the previous generation of $10,000 - $20,000 displays by companies like NVIS have mostly been supplanted by a new generation of low cost gaming-related displays:
Oculus VR
Sony
Hololens
HTC Vive
and there are other interesting solutions that have been in development for a couple decades such as the Virtual Retinal Display

## Current Uses
* Demonstrations
* Vehicle Design (e.g. General Motors, Caterpillar, Boeing)
* Architectural Walkthroughs
Entertainment
Scientific Visualization
Education and Training
There is quite a bit of work going on in various research labs in VR. New devices are being created, new application areas being worked on, new interaction techniques being explored, and user studies being performed to see if any of these are valuable. What is much harder is getting the technology and the applications out of the research lab and into real use at other sites - getting beyond the 'demo' stage to the 'practical use' stage is still very difficult.
