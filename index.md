## ARTTECH 4135
Term: SPRING, 2018
Schedule: Monday & Wednesday from 5-8 PM
Location: MacLean 402
Instructor: Brenda Lopez blopez3@artic.edu
 

# OVERVIEW
The Virtual Reality course will introduce students to the creation of interactive Virtual Reality environments for different technologies such as the Google cardboard, Head Mounted Displays (HTC Vive or Oculus) and CAVE like system. The class will cover the necessary topics such as 360° video, modeling, animation, interaction, and sound for the integration of real-time interactive environments. 

We will consider various artworks created for Virtual Reality as well as other immersive techniques. The presentations will open a space for discourse about current issues relevant to virtual reality and immersive environments.
 
# LEARNING GOALS
The basics: To learn the basics of VR before digging into deeper contents.
Presence and Immersion: We will learn the differences between immersion and presence, and how to create both for fully engaging experiences.
Self-embodiment: Learn how to fully bring users into your creations that goes far beyond simply being a disembodied viewpoint in space.
Goal-driven design: Select the most appropriate hardware and interaction patterns/techniques that best fits your project goals.
Taking action: The class will include plans of action that anyone can follow to start creating VR environments.
PRIOR Knowledge
No prior knowledge is expected beyond a basic understanding of computers and applications. Familiarly with a programming language will be helpful.

# Acknowledgements 
This course has been developed at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. I borrowed liberally from my colleagues' efforts in this area and my experience as a student in the Electronic Visualization Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Colleagues that I have benefited from include Michael Papka (NIU), Andy Johnson (UIC). In addition, a number of discussions with Lance Long, Alex Betts, and Edouard Brooks.
