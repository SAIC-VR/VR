### Virtual Reality

OVERVIEW
> Immersive Environments will introduce students to the creation of interactive Virtual Reality environments for large format displays such as the CAVE2. The class will cover the necessary topics such as modeling, animation, interaction, and audio components for the integration of real-time interactive environments. 
We will consider various artworks created for Virtual Reality as well as other immersive techniques. The presentations of readings will open a space for discourse about multiple topics and issues relevant to immersive environments.
